LCD Display for Temp. Sensors

This is a python script to display 3 Temperature sensors with th Current Time to a 16x2 LCD Display. 
It's attached to a Raspberry Pi 3 running Reef-Pi in my custom enclosure, with an Optical Sensor and various LEDs. I really like it!
I call this device Aqua-Pi and it monitors my aquarium and sends data to Home Assitant.
